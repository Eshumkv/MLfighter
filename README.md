# ML Fighter

Welcome to this repository. This is an attempt at learning machine learning. 

## The idea

The idea was to create a game that a computer could learn.
This game will be simple, just a dude running around with a gun.
There will be spots to "hide" from enemies.
Enemies will spawn in waves and there *might* be pickups.

## Afterwards

I plan to make a machine learning algorithm that actually **learns**
to play the game. Don't know exactly how yet. 
This section will be filled when I do know.
